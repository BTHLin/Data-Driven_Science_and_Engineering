This python program uses Beausifulsoup package to scrape the data from weather underground and calculate the density altitude, then upload the data into a SQL server.  
To use the program, simply replace the requestURL in get_target_webpage function (table for each page may be different, therefore some small changes may be required.)  
To upload the data to a SQL database, update database and server credential in main function.
